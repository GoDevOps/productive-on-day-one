# Dev and Ops productive on day one and ever after

[![build-web-site](https://github.com/GoDevOps/productive-on-day-one/workflows/build-web-site/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GoDevOps/productive-on-day-one/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild-web-site+branch%3Amain)

## Purpose

In a software powered company, nothing is more important than developer and operations productivity. Ideally, one should be able
make change in production - through the safety of a CI and CD pipeline - on day 1 on the job.

Developing an application, a service or infrastructure "as code" requires many elements to be in place to be productive. This includes IDEs,
test tools, SDKs, emulators and connecting them all to the target environments. Those prerequisites are cumbersome to install, to
configure and to maintain. On the other end, we need our application and infrastructure developers to be effective as quickly as
possible and minimize the onboarding process. With an all - or partially - remote workforce, getting an environment to work
effectively quickly is even more beneficial as it's more difficult to tap on the shoulder of a colleague and ask for help.

This talk shares multiple recipes that we've put in place to get to this "productive on day 1" ideal, including on very
restrictive and regulated environments. The PC/MAC itself, the Integrated Developer Environment (IDE), running the service or
application locally, as well as everything needed to manage infrastructure. We go through different solutions for 3 typical
profiles: a front-end developer, a data scientist and an infrastructure as code developer.
